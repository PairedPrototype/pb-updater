# PairedPrototype's PhantomBot Updater

## Introduction

I host several PB chatbots for a few friends and wanted a way to easily update them. So I made this script and tried to
expand it for more general use so others could make use of this as well. And now I'm sharing it with you. ðŸ˜Š

## TODO

1. Use the Github API to check for releases rather than the build.xml
1. Add an update checker
1. Option to save user variables (use a dot file and then source it)
1. Create Contribution.md guide
